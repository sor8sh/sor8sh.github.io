I am a Master's student at the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. [[Curriculum Vitae](https:sorooosh.github.io/files/cv.pdf)]

My research interests lie in the area of Machine Learning, particularly in Deep Learning, and its applications in other areas, such as Bioinformatics. In addition, I am interested in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I am a researcher at Bioinformatics lab in UWaterloo Davis Center, advised by Professor [Bin Ma](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~binma/). I got my Bachelor's degree from Iran University of Science and Technology. My B.Sc. final project was under the supervision of Prof. [Sauleh Etemadi](https:sauleh.github.io).
