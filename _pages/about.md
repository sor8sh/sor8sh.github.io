I am a Senior Data Scientist at [Shift Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shift-technology/),
where I work on developing Machine Learning models for anomaly detection on large-scale insurance data.

I completed my Master's in Computer Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/),
where I was a research assistant at the Bioinformatics lab under the supervision of Professor [Bin Ma](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~binma/).

I like solving problems that are too complex or time-consuming for humans to handle manually.
Most of my work involves using machine learning to find unique patterns in large datasets.
I’m especially interested in pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and natural language processing.
